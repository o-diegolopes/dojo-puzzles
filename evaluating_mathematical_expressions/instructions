Evaluating Mathematical Expressions

Given a mathematical expression in infix notation, evaluate your result. For example:

3 * ( 2 + 5 ) = 21
3 * ( 2 + 5 * 2) = 36

Tip: In the usual infix notation, operators are written between operands.
     In postfix notation, operators are written after operands.

Infix: 3 * ( 2 + 5)
Postfix: 3 2 5 + *
